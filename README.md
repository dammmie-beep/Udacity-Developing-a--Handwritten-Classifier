Based on the extracted content from your notebook, here are the important points that can be included in the README:

This project involves developing a neural network model using PyTorch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Below are the key steps and considerations taken throughout the project.

## 1. Introduction

In this project, a neural network is built to evaluate the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark in the field of machine learning, with various models achieving high accuracy rates. This project aims to develop a neural network model that can effectively classify the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset.

## 2. Data Loading and Exploration

### Dataset Loading
- The dataset is loaded using the `MNIST` object from `torchvision.datasets`, with necessary transformations applied using `transforms.ToTensor()`.
- Data is split into training and testing sets, and `DataLoader` objects are created for both sets to facilitate batch processing.

### Data Transformation
- Transformations include converting images to tensors for compatibility with PyTorch models. Additional transformations, such as normalization and flattening, can be applied to enhance model training.

### Dataset Exploration
- The dataset dimensions are explored using tools like `matplotlib` and `numpy` to ensure the data is in the correct format for training.
- A function (`show5`) is used to visualize sample images from the dataset, which is crucial for understanding the data before model training.

## 3. Model Design and Training

### Neural Network Construction
- A neural network model is constructed using PyTorch, including at least two hidden layers.
- The model is designed to output a probability distribution across the 10 classes using the softmax activation function in the forward method.

### Model Training
- The model is trained using the training set, with appropriate loss functions and optimizers applied to minimize errors and improve accuracy.

## 4. Model Testing and Evaluation

### Accuracy Testing
- The trained model is evaluated using the test set to determine its accuracy in classifying handwritten digits.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Various hyperparameters, including learning rate and batch size, are tuned to achieve a desired level of accuracy.
- The model achieves a classification accuracy of at least 90% on the test dataset.

### Model Saving
- The final trained model is saved using `torch.save()` for future use or further fine-tuning.
